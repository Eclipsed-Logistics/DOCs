Effects:
  - Detriment: Weakness to Water [Build: -10] {Body: 0}
    > Any damaging water effects deal double the amount of damage to the Android, the android also cannot be healed by any water
      effects.
  - Detriment: Weakness to Acid [Build: -10] {Body: 0}
    > Any damaging Acid effects deal double damage to the android, attacking plating first.
  - Resistance to Electricity [Build: 15] {Body: 2}
    > Any electric effect that would damage the Android is halved (rounded up).
  - Assimilate Weaponry [Build: 10] {Body: 4}
    > Android are an adaptable race, the player can pick a weapon type (Sword, Axe, etc.) and call out, while holding said weapon,
      “Assimilate Weaponry:__” whatever weapon they are assimilating is called out as well, giving them a +2 to all attacks made with
      said weapon type.

Skills:
  - Built Tough (LvMAX. 3) [Build Per: 5] {Body Per: 2}
    > Androids as a race are built tougher than other races, purely from their metal body giving them an advantage as tanks in the
      world of heroes and villains. Purchasing this skill reduces tanking abilities cost by one for each purchase.
  - Plating (LvMAX. 45) [Build Per: 1] {Body Per: 0}
    > Works similar to normal armor. Value is 2 points of armor per purchase. Armor can be replenished in 60 seconds of time re-adjusting
      the plating. This skill will follow maximum value limited in the armoring system just like physical armor. This skill stacks with
      normal armor.
