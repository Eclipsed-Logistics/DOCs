      surroundings.
  - Sorcery Healer {DOC_H###}
    > Take command of both life and death on the battlefield. Use your unseen forces to introduce attacking arcane creatures, or
      generate karma to influence friends and foes. Having Summoning and Destiny provides a powerful, manipulative influence in
      The Universe.

    > Keep your allies alive with powerful storms and flowing water. Command water in and around allies and enemies. Bend and
      blast water into incredible streams and torrents to unleash a flood of destruction, or shape it into awe-inspiring
      constructs to wash away your enemies in the Damage role. Soothe the wounds of your allies or envelop them and yourself with
      the shielding power of water in the Healer role.
