# DOCs
This one will actually contain the docs.

  You shouldn't need to download the repository. Make sure that you are viewing the correct branch, and then just do whatever you need
to do. Use the 'edits' branch for making edits to existing files. Use the 'new_files' branch for adding entirely new files.

MAKE SURE TO COMMIT YOUR CHANGES OR IT ***WILL NOT*** SAVE!
